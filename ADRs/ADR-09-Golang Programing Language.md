# ADR-09: Golang Programing Language

## Date:
2024-09-28

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
We are developing a backend system for a scalable application that requires high performance, concurrency handling, and ease of deployment.

## Decision:
We will use Go (Golang) with the Gin framework as our backend programming language and web framework. The combination offers a powerful solution for building RESTful APIs while leveraging Go's strengths in concurrency and deployment.

## Consequences:
### PROS:
- *Performance:* Go is a compiled language that offers excellent performance. The Gin framework is designed to be lightweight and efficient, providing fast HTTP routing.
- *Concurrency Support:* Go's goroutines and channels facilitate handling multiple requests simultaneously, making it ideal for high-traffic applications.
- *Minimalist and Flexible:* Gin follows a minimalist design philosophy while allowing for flexibility in structuring applications, making it easy to get started and scale.
- *Rich Middleware Support:* Gin provides a robust middleware system, allowing us to easily implement functionalities such as authentication, logging, and error handling.
- *Strong Community and Documentation:* Go and Gin have active communities and comprehensive documentation, which can be beneficial for troubleshooting and support.

### Cons:
- *Learning Curve:* Although Go's syntax is straightforward, developers new to Go may require time to adapt to its idioms and conventions.
- *Error Handling:* Goâ€™s approach to error handling can be verbose, requiring explicit checks that may feel cumbersome compared to exceptions in other languages.
