## Context

The organization requires a Business Intelligence (BI) solution to analyze data, generate insights, and create reports for various stakeholders. The solution must be scalable, user-friendly, and capable of integrating with existing data sources.  

### Key factors considered:
- **Ease of Use**: The solution should allow non-technical users to easily create reports and dashboards.
- **Integration**: The BI tool must seamlessly integrate with AWS services and data sources.
- **Scalability**: It must handle varying amounts of data as the organization grows.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: The solution should fit within budget constraints.

## Decision

We will use **AWS QuickSight** as the BI solution for our data visualization and reporting needs.  

### Considered Options:
#### **AWS QuickSight**
- **Pros**:
  - Fully managed and serverless, reducing operational overhead.
  - Easy integration with AWS data sources (e.g., S3, RDS, Redshift).
  - Supports interactive dashboards and visualizations.
  - Offers a pay-per-session pricing model, making it cost-effective for variable usage.
- **Cons**:
  - Limited customization options compared to some other BI tools.
  - May require additional setup for complex data transformations.

#### **Tableau**
- **Pros**:
  - Highly customizable and offers powerful data visualization capabilities.
  - Strong community and support.
- **Cons**:
  - Higher cost, especially for licensing.
  - More complex setup and maintenance compared to QuickSight.

#### **Power BI**
- **Pros**:
  - Good integration with Microsoft products.
  - Robust features for data modeling and visualization.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires additional licensing for enterprise features.
  - Integration with AWS data sources can be cumbersome.

#### **Looker**
- **Pros**:
  - Strong data modeling capabilities and collaboration features.
- **Cons**:
  - Higher operational costs.
  - More complex deployment and maintenance.

### Decision Rationale
We chose AWS QuickSight because it effectively meets our requirements:
- **Ease of Use**: QuickSight's intuitive interface allows non-technical users to create dashboards and reports without extensive training.
- **Seamless Integration**: It integrates well with our existing AWS ecosystem, allowing for straightforward access to data stored in AWS services.
- **Scalability and Performance**: As a serverless solution, QuickSight automatically scales with our data, ensuring performance remains high as usage grows.
- **Cost-Effective**: The pay-per-session pricing model makes it suitable for our budget, especially considering variable user engagement.

## Consequences
- **Limited Customization**: While QuickSight is user-friendly, it may not provide the same level of customization as other tools. We will need to balance user needs with available features.
- **Data Preparation**: Some complex data preparation tasks may require additional tools or services, which could add to the overall solution complexity.

## Next Steps
1. Set up AWS QuickSight and connect it to our data sources.
2. Train users on how to create and manage dashboards and reports.
3. Develop a plan for ongoing data governance and management to ensure data quality and accessibility.
