## Date:
2024-09-28

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
We are developing a single-page application that requires a responsive, dynamic user interface with efficient state management and a smooth user experience. The decision is needed to address which technology to be used for the end user facing single page application.

## Decision:
We will use React as the primary framework for developing the SPA.

## Consequences:
### PROS:
- *Component-Based Architecture:* Reactâ€™s reusable components promote maintainability and scalability.
- *Virtual DOM:* Efficient updates and rendering lead to better performance, especially for dynamic applications.
- *Strong Community and Ecosystem:* Extensive libraries and tools (e.g., Redux, React Router) facilitate development.
- *Rich Ecosystem for State Management:* Libraries like Redux and Context API provide robust state management solutions.
- *Popularity and Job Market:* React is widely used, which makes finding developers easier and ensures long-term support.

### Cons:
- *Learning Curve:* New developers may find JSX and the component lifecycle challenging.
- *Frequent Updates:* Constant updates can lead to versioning issues and require ongoing learning.
