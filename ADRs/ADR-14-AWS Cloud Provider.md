## Date:
2024-09-28

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
We are looking to deploy our application in a cloud environment that offers scalability, reliability, and a wide range of services to support our development and operational needs.

## Decision:
We will use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as our cloud provider.

## Consequences:
### PROS:
- *Comprehensive Service Offering:* AWS provides a vast array of services allowing us to leverage a single provider for our diverse needs.
- *Scalability:* AWS's auto-scaling capabilities and load balancing ensure that our application can handle varying levels of traffic seamlessly.
- *Global Infrastructure:* With numerous data centers worldwide, AWS allows for low-latency access and redundancy, supporting our goal for a global reach.
- *Strong Security and Compliance:* AWS offers robust security features and compliance certifications, which are critical for protecting sensitive data and meeting regulatory requirements.
- *Active Ecosystem and Community:* A large community and extensive documentation can help accelerate development and troubleshooting.

### Cons:
- *Cost Complexity:* The pricing model can be complex and may lead to unexpected costs if not managed carefully.
- *Learning Curve:* AWS's vast array of services can be overwhelming for new users, requiring time to familiarize ourselves with best practices.
- *Vendor Lock-In:* Depending heavily on AWS services may create challenges if we decide to migrate to another provider in the future.
