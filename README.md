## Introduction
Discrimination in recruitment continues to be a significant global issue. Research shows that individuals from marginalized groups, such as people with disabilities, women, ethnic minorities, and members of the LGBTQ+ community, encounter various barriers in securing employment.

For instance, a Harvard Business School study found that ethnic minorities are 24% less likely to receive a callback for an interview compared to equally qualified white applicants. Additionally, the Pew Research Center reported that 42% of women experience workplace discrimination. Traditional hiring systems perpetuate unconscious bias, often preventing diverse talent from receiving equal consideration.

Organizations like the Diversity Cyber Council, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, are working to address these inequities, specifically in the tech industry. Through education, training, and staffing opportunities, they aim to create a sustainable and diverse talent pipeline. However, these efforts alone are insufficient without significant changes to the hiring process itselfâ€”this is where our application plays a key role.

### Problem Statement
The current hiring process faces significant challenges in promoting fairness and eliminating bias:

**Lack of Effective Metrics:** There is an absence of reliable metrics to accurately identify and reduce bias during recruitment. Many systems rely on diversity data early in the process, which can unintentionally introduce bias rather than prevent it. Our approach removes diversity-related data at the initial stages, ensuring decisions are made solely based on objective qualifications and experience.

**Ineffective Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS):** Traditional ATS, often referred to as HR systems, are redundant and inefficient in matching suitable candidates to job roles. This leads to missed opportunities, with qualified candidates frequently overlooked or mismatched due to poor filtering mechanisms.

Our solution eliminates diversity data from the early screening stages, creating a more objective and merit-based hiring process focused solely on candidates' qualifications.

![Architecture Characteristics](/Images/Architecture_Characteristics_Worksheet.png)

## Top 3 Characteristics
The key architectural characteristics of the recruitment system that leverages AI LLM for resume recommendations, candidate scoring, and job matching, while integrating with multiple HRMS systems, focus on **Scalability**, **Performance**, and **Interoperability**. Here's how these characteristics shape the system:

### 1. **Scalability**
- **Handling Growth**: The system must efficiently scale to accommodate an increasing number of candidates, resumes, and job postings as businesses expand. Scalability ensures smooth operation under fluctuating workloads, including more AI-driven analysis and HRMS integrations.
- **AI Resource Optimization**: As the system processes more resumes and handles higher candidate scoring and job matching volumes, resources need to be dynamically managed to support seamless AI model execution, especially during peak loads.

### 2. **Performance**
- **Fast AI-Driven Results**: High computational performance is essential for AI LLM models to provide real-time resume recommendations and candidate scoring, delivering immediate feedback to users on job matches and recommendations.
- **Efficient HRMS Data Retrieval**: The system must rapidly fetch job details and other data from multiple HRMS systems without introducing latency, ensuring job matching is prompt and system responsiveness is maintained.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Fast, reliable responses to user actionsâ€”such as uploading resumes or generating job matchesâ€”are crucial for delivering a smooth and efficient experience for both candidates and recruiters.

### 3. **Interoperability**
- **Seamless HRMS Integration**: The system needs to integrate effortlessly with various external HRMS platforms, regardless of their underlying technology or data formats, ensuring smooth communication and data exchange.
- **Consistent Data Formatting**: With different HRMS systems potentially using varied data structures, interoperability ensures standardized data handling, enabling the AI models to process information accurately across platforms.
- **Future-Proofing**: Interoperability allows the recruitment system to integrate with new HRMS platforms or technologies over time, adapting to evolving business requirements without major re-engineering efforts.

## Implicit Characteristics
### Feasibility (Cost/Time)
Achieving rapid time-to-market while managing development costs is a feasible goal with the selected "mini-services" architecture.
### Maintainability
Ensuring clean code, documentation, and knowledge sharing within the development team are essential for long-term system maintainability.
### Observability
Implementing comprehensive monitoring and observability solutions enables efficient tracking of system performance and early issue detection for proactive problem-solving.


## Architecture Approach
### Architecture Style

![Architecture Style](/Images/Architecture_Styles_Worksheet.png)

  
## Event Storming
We conducted an Event Storming technique to identify the main components of the Clearview system. This collaborative workshop helped us visualize system workflows, identify domain events, and determine the interactions between components. Through this process, we [identified the necessary components and their relationships](EventStorming/EventStorming.md), informing the design and implementation of the system. Here are the results:

<img src="EventStorming/images/components.png" />

Each microservice operates within its defined bounded context, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. This modular approach enhances the system's maintainability, scalability, and overall performance, allowing each service to evolve independently while contributing to the cohesive functionality of the entire platform.

## Context
### Complete Overview

![Overview](/C4Diagram/img/ClearViewC4%20diagramOverview.png)

### Context Diagram
C1 in the C4 model, known as the Context view, offers a bird's-eye perspective of the system, illustrating its external interactions and dependencies. It depicts the system as a single entity surrounded by external actors, and environments with which it interacts. This view helps stakeholders understand the system's place within its broader ecosystem and the key interactions it has with its surroundings.
![Context](/C4Diagram/img/ClearView-Context%20diagram.png)
ClearView context diagram contains following elements:

* *Candidate (Actor)*  - A  Candidate is a professional who seeking a less tedious and more equitable hiring process that values their skills and abilities. 
* *Employer (Actor)*  - Companies invested in providing a more equitable experience to career seekers
* *Administrator (Actor)* - Oversees the HR system, managing user accounts for candidates and employers. 
* *ClearView System (Application)* -A platform that anonymizes candidate information while highlighting objective skills and qualifying experience with help of AI to reduce bias in the hiring process. .

* *Trascational database* - A database used by the microservices or macroservices to store data such as users, roles, and resumes, etc.
* *Object Store* - Stores resumes in their raw format in a secure way
  
## Components
### API Application
![API Application](/C4Diagram/img/ClearViewC4ComponentDiagram.png)
ClearView component diagram contains following elements:

* *API Gateway (module)*  -The API Gateway serves as a bridge between external clients (users or systems) and internal services. It consolidates API requests, managing tasks such as request routing, composition, and often implementing features like rate limiting, security, and monitoring.
* *Aggregate API  (module)*  - The Aggregate API communicates with multiple services on behalf of external clients (such as users or systems), gathering and delivering data in a consolidated response.
* *Account API  (Module)* -  The Account API handles the management of candidate, employer, admin, and company information. 
* *Resume API (Module)* -Manages resumes and sends data to the AI service for story creation and anonymization.
* *Jobs API  (Module)* - Handles the management of all jobs created by the employer..
* *Job Matcher API  (Module)* - A module for finding and listing matches identified through AI.

### HR Orchestrator Engine

[ADR-12: Orchestrator Engine Integration using Kafka](ADRs/ADR-12-OrchestratorEngine.md%20Integration.md)
### AI Engine
![AI Engine](/C4Diagram/img/ClearViewC4AIModel.png)

#### Vector Database
Any resume that is created or uploaded, along with any job posting submitted, will be parsed into specific sections (e.g., skills, experience, job role) and then stored in the Vector Database with corresponding context embeddings. Detailed information in [ADR-03](ADRs/ADR-03-Vector%20Database.md).

#### Knowledge Graph
In parallel, we will extract key entities, attributes, and relationships from the job descriptions, skills, roles, and experience data, which will then be updated within the Knowledge Graph through graphical embeddings. Detailed information in [ADR-04](ADRs/ADR-04-Knowledge%20Graph.md).

#### Retriever API
Both the Vector Database and Knowledge Graph will leverage similarity metrics such as `Euclidean Distance`, `Cosine Similarity`, `Jaccard Similarity`, and `SimRank` to determine relevance. These metrics will return a list of matching records in real-time. The Retriever component will then perform an additional layer of filtering using thresholding or top-N result selection to eliminate low-relevance matches.

After filtering, the retriever will utilize an LLM to re-rank the remaining results based on their relevance to the query, improving overall matching accuracy. The integration of the Knowledge Graph and Vector Database helps mitigate hallucinations often seen in LLMs, significantly enhancing system accuracy. More details in re-ranker on the [ARD-05](ADRs/ADR-05-Document-ReRanker.md)

#### Gen AI based LLM 
Finally, we will use context-driven prompts within the LLM to generate tailored feedback for resumes or to create personalized story of candidate candidate-job matching recommendations. The personalized story would be done in batch processing to provide parallelism. We can also fine tune the above LLM on the survey feedback obtained by Candidates and by HR, on which further details are mentioned in [ARD-06](ADRs/ADR-06-LLM%20Fine%20tuning.md)

This approach provides high precision, reduces noise, and ensures an efficient, context-aware feedback loop for both candidates and HR professionals with near real-time feedback and highly performant candidate matching.


### Analytics Engine
